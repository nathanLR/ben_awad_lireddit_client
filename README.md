### Lireddit client

This is the client side of a full stack application, based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8) from [Ben AWAD](https://www.youtube.com/@bawad). The stack is a tiny bit different from the tutorial, the visuals are enhanced and additional features are present.

It uses the following stack :
- Typescript
- React
- NextJS
- Apollo Client
- Graphql
- Chakra UI
